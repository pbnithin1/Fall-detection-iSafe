# Fall-detection-iSafe

This repository, named "Fall-detection-iSafe," is dedicated to a Fall Detection System project. The project log is organized into different folders representing various stages of development.

## Folders:
There will be 2 folders in each:
1. Contains code file
2. Output files associated with the code in the 'code' folder.
### initial_stage:
```
1. depth: Depth-related code.
2. integrated: Integrated code.
3. play_with_cam: Code related to camera interaction.
4. rgb_depth2d: Code for processing RGB and depth data.
```
### 12_10:
```
1. cog from video: Code for extracting Center of Gravity (COG) from video.
2. COG_atfeet: Code related to COG at the feet.
3. Final_cog4: Final COG-related code.
```

### 13_10:
```
1. cog skeletal: Code for skeletal COG.
2. quadriateral: Code for quadrilateral.
```
### 23-11:
```
1. cog_out_quad: Code related to combining COG and quadrilateral.
2. fall_based_on_pose: Code related to fall detection based on pose.
3. pose_detection: Code related to general pose detection.
```
